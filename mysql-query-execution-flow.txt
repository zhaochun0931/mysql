Query Execution Flow in MySQL:

Query Input: The user inputs an SQL query.

Parser: The query goes through the parser, which checks the syntax and creates a parse tree.

Analyzer: The analyzer checks if the SQL query is semantically valid (checks for table and column existence, permission checks).

Optimizer: The optimizer takes over and generates an execution plan that optimizes the performance of the query.

Execution: The execution engine finally runs the query based on the optimized plan.






Parser -> Analyzer -> Optimizer
